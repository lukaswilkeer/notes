/*
* The goal of this note is demonstrate how to profund handling erros in a
* imperative style
*
* On this note, we simulate a MVC approach on an express application with a 
* db connection based on callback(like native drivers),
* and an error on this call. The script that calls the database, providing an error,
* cannot crash the system. The error needs to get outputed to the userÂ¹.
*
* About the fact that MVC is a OOP approach, the MVC pattern can be applied to a
* imperative system since that the code on a imperative style. ON this note we achieve this goal
* by using it of a way of sepere concerns, tha names is very conveniet and the fact that almost
* everyone knows this pattern.
*
* To achieve the goal, we use nested try/catch blocks.
*
* Sidenotes
* 1 - On an human readable way.
